Hello, World!

My name is Pedro Afonso, I'm Brazilian, 30 years old, graduated as Control and Automation Engineer and I have a master degree in Automation and Systems Engineer. 

I'm starting to learn JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3. I know it will be a long and hard journey, but I'm excited for it and I'll do my best!
